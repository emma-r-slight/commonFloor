Welcome to Commonfloor. We're making real-world-impact on disrupting current body corporate management by enhancing transparency in fund management and empowering every resident to have a voice and influence in decision-making.

Our innovative solution is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) integrated in a webapp UI, built on the Sepolia testnet using NZDD. 

By leveraging this technology, CommonFloor empowers residents to collectively create and comment on proposals, vote on vendors, monitor expenditures, and even invest unused funds into yield-generating assets. Transforms how communities manage their shared resources and governance.

# Problem Statement:
How might we make spending and decision-making more transparent and accessible to all stakeholders?

Coming from our team member's negative experiences in dealing with body corp, we realise how many pain points there are. 
Since there are more and more people living in strata housing nowadays in Auckland (over 42k apartments in Auckland since 2023), we believe there's a critical need for change but they aren't addressed.

# Research
To validate our hypothesis of the pain points and ideas, we sent out the survey during hackathon and has gathered valuable feedback from 11 respondents.

## Key Takeaway: 
1. 100% of respondents have wanted to raise proposals to their body corp, and 88% of them feel like the process is either too complicated or too much hassel.
2. The top 2 features requested is 1) More transparency on how funds are used 2) Be able to create proposals
